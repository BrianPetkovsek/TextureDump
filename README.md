# TextureDump
Texture Map Dumper for Minecraft Forge

Helps diagnose problems with the texture map and find mods that add huge or strangely-sized textures.

# Instructions

[Download from Github](https://github.com/mezz/TextureDump/releases)

Just drop the Texture Dump mod into your `mods` folder and start the game.   
It will generate texture map images, interactive html files, and json information files in the `texture_dump` folder.  
Check the log for any errors and report bugs back here.

# Results

 * An image of the texture map is created and saved.  
 * An interactive page is generated, where you can hover over textures to see which mod they came from, their name, and their size.
 * A json file is created with all the texture properties in the map, for creating your own analysis.
